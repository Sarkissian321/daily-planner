# daily-planner
This is a work-day planner to help you schedule workday hours from 9AM to 5PM. Users can input tasks and save their tasks on the planner and it will color-code their tasks as past, present, and future. Past tasks will show in orange, present tasks in blue/green, and future tasks will be purple. 
In addition, the current day and time is displayed on top of the page. 

Here is a link to the deployed page: https://sarkissian321.github.io/daily-planner/

Here is a screenshot of how the page looks like when opened:
